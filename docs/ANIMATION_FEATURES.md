```tsx
transition={{ duration: 0.5, delay: 0.1 }}
```

### Change Animation Type
Replace `initial` and `animate` props:
```tsx
initial={{ opacity: 0, scale: 0.8 }}
animate={{ opacity: 1, scale: 1 }}
```

### Add New Animations
Use the utilities in `globals.css` or create custom ones using Framer Motion.

## üí° Tips

1. **Email Testing**: Use Resend's test mode during development
2. **Form Validation**: Both forms have client-side validation
